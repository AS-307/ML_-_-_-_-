### A Workaround if Jupyter notebooks are not rendered

If you get a message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb files,
try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"

Paste the link to your notebook, 
(e.g. "https://github.com/capissimo/Machine-Learning-with-Python-Cookbook/blob/master/simulated_test_datasets.ipynb") there 
and then you get 
"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/capissimo/Machine-Learning-with-Python-Cookbook/blob/master/simulated_test_datasets.ipynb"

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
